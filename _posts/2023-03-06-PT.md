### Ideas for Midterm Project
> Midterm project culminates with a 15-25 minute lesson and hacks.  In the lesson, I want a focus on one of the FRQ types, a key data structure, and you should show managing and ordering data (aka sorting).  Make sure you are unique from other 8 projects in your classroom.
